_Piikki_ is a pre-payment system for small societies such as university clubs and non-profit organizations. Its purpose is to replace the classic tab-paper-sheet taped on the fridge door and offer users an easy way to check off refreshments and keep book of their own tab saldo.

_Piikki_ is designed to handle multiple user groups with one backend service. This allows users to have tab saldos in different groups and the possibility to use them all within one client application.

This github project only includes server backend and api of the Piikki pre-payment system.
